# Usage
## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Terminal that supports curses

## Running the Editor
1. Save the script as editor.py (or any filename you want).
2. Run the script from the terminal, providing the name of the file you want to edit:
```bash
python editor.py <filename>
```
If the file doesn't exist, it will be created when you save.

## Controls

|-------------|-------------|
| Arrow Keys |	Move the cursor up, down, left, or right. |
| Enter |	Insert a new line at the cursor position. |
| Backspace	| Delete the character before the cursor. |
| Delete | Delete the character under the cursor. |

## Special Formatting Rules
- Lines starting with `>>>` are rendered in bold.
- Lines starting with `*` or `-` are treated as list items and rendered with a bullet (â€¢) and proper spacing.

## Example
### Input
```text
>>> This is a bold line.
* This is a bullet point.

Regular text here.
```
### Display
